Write a program that will ask a user for an input of a word or multiple words and give back the number of characters. Spaces should not be counted as a character.

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - A user-entered string

  Outputs: 
    - A string containing integer number of characters

  Explicit Rules:
    - Spaces should not be counted as a character

  Implicit Rules:
    - User should enter input on same line as prompt
    - Display the entered string in the output
    - Removing whitespace should not mutate the original string

  Questions:
  - What should happen if a user enters an empty string?

  Mental Model:
     Ask the user to enter a string, store that response. Remove the spaces from the string, then count the number of characters in the string. Print the result to the screen.
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  ** Example 1 **
  Please write word or multiple words: walk
  There are 4 characters in "walk".

  ** Example 2 ** 
  Please write word or multiple words: walk, don't run
  There are 13 characters in "walk, don't run".

  ** Example 3 ** (I'm choosing this in lieu of an answer)
  Please write word or multiple words:
  There are 0 characters in "". 

D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  None

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Ask user to enter a word / multiple words, create a variable `string` to store the response
  2. Create a variable `string_with_no_spaces` to store the result of removing the whitespaces from the string
    1. To remove whitespaces, iterate through the string character by character
    2. Check if the value of the character is equal to " "
      A: If yes, do nothing
      B: If no, add the character to `string_with_no_spaces`
  3. Print the number of characters in  `string_with_no_spaces`
