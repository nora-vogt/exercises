Write a method that takes a string argument, and returns true if all of the alphabetic characters inside the string are uppercase, false otherwise. Characters that are not alphabetic should be ignored.

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - A string


  Outputs: 
    - A Boolean, true if all alphabetic characters in string are uppercase, false otherwise

  Explicit Rules:
    - Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored
    - A string with lowercase characters should return false

  Implicit Rules:
    - An empty string should return true
    - Since non-alphabetic characters are ignored, a string containing only whitespace should return true

  Questions:

  Mental Model:
   Check only the alphabetic characters in a string. If they are all uppercase, return true. If not, return false.
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  uppercase?('t') == false
  uppercase?('T') == true
  uppercase?('Four Score') == false
  uppercase?('FOUR SCORE') == true
  uppercase?('4SCORE!') == true
  uppercase?('') == true

D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++


A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Collect only the alphabetic characters in a new string, save in variable 'alphabetic_chars'
  2. Iterate through alphabetic_chars, character by character
    1. Compare the current character to the upcased version of the character
    2. If the values are equal, do nothing
    3. If the values are not equal, return false
  3. After iterating, if the method has not returned, return true
