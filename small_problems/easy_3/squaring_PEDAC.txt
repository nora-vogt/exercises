Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - A number

  Outputs: 
    - A number

  Explicit Rules:
    - Use the multiply method from previous assignment
    - The square is the result of multiplying a number by itself

  Implicit Rules:
    - Squaring a negative number results in a positive number

  Questions:
  - 

  Mental Model:
   Use the previously defined multiply method to multiply a number by itself to compute the square.
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  square(5) == 25
  square(-8) == 64

D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  None

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Call the multiply method to compute the square
    2. Pass the argument twice as both parameters
  2. Return the square
