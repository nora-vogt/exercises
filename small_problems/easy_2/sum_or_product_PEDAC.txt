Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - From user, an integer greater than 0 (Integer)
    - From user, choice of sum or product (string)
  Outputs: 
    - Sum of all numbers between 1 and entered integer (Integer)

  Explicit Rules:
    - Ask the user for a number
    - Entered number must be an Integer
    - Entered number must be greater than zero
    - Ask user to determine sum or product

  Implicit Rules:
    - Sum is determined by adding every number between 1 and Integer
    - Product is determined by multipluing ever number between 1 and Integer

  Questions:
    - What should happen if user enters an invalid number?
    - Or invalid computation?

  Mental Model:
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  >> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
  5
  >> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
  s
  The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.


  >> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
  6
  >> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
  p
  The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.

D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Integer

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Ask user to enter a whole number greater than zero, store that number in variable 'number'
  2. Ask user to enter sum or product, store that choice in variable 'calculation_choice'
  3. If calculation_choice
    A: == 's', compute the sum:
      1. Initialize variable 'sum' to zero, to reflect the sum
      2. Iterate through all numbers between 1 and number
        A. Add the value of each number to sum
      3. Print the sum
    B: == 'p', compute the product
      1. Initialize variable 'product' to 1, to reflect the product
      2. Iterate through all numbers between 1 and number
        A. Multiply number by product, and add that value to product
      3. Print the product
