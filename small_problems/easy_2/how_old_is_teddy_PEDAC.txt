Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age. To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 200.

Example Output:
Teddy is 69 years old!

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - nothing?
  Outputs: 
    - A random number between 20 and 200, interpolated in a string

  Explicit Rules:
    - Interpolate the results in a string: "Teddy is X years old!"
    - The age number must be generated randomly
    - Print the string to the screen

  Implicit Rules:
    - None

  Questions:
  - Does the valid range include or exclude 20 and 200?

  Mental Model:
  Generate a random number between 20 and 200, interpolate that number into a string describing Teddy's age, print the string to the screen.
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++

Teddy is 69 years old!

If inclusive:
Teddy is 20 years old!

If exclusive:
Teddy is 199 years old!


D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  String

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Initialize a variable 'age', assign a random number between 20 and 200 as the value. (I will choose inclusive)
  2. Interpolate age into a string as Teddy's age
  3. Print the string
