Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters and then displays the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.

Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

Do not worry about validating the input at this time.

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - Length of room in meters (a number)
    - Width of room in meters (a number)
  Outputs: 
  - Interpolated into a string:
    - Area of room in square meters (a Float)
    - Area of room in square feet (a Float)
    

  Explicit Rules:
    - Ask the user for length and width of room in meters
    - 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet
    - Don't need to validate input

  Implicit Rules:
    - Square meters == length in meters x width in meters
    - use puts to display prompts to user
    - Round the square meter display to 2 decimal points
    - Round the square feet display to 2 decimal points
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Enter the length of the room in meters:
  10
  Enter the width of the room in meters:
  7
  The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet).

D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  - Numbers - Integers and Floats

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Ask the user to enter room length in meters
    1. Convert input to Float
    2. Initialize a local variable 'length' and assign value of user input
  2. Ask the user to enter room width in meters
    1. Convert input to Float
    2. Initialize a local variable 'width' and assign value of user input
  3. Initialize variable 'square_meters', assign it to the value of calculating (length * witdh)
  4. Initialize variable 'square_feet', assign it to the value of calculating (square_meters * 10.7639).
  5. Print values of square_meters and square_feet interpolated into a string with data about room area.
