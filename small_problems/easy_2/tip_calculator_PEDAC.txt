Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs: 
  - Bill total (a number)
  - Tip percentage (a number)

  Outputs: 
  - Tip dollar amount (Float)
  - Total bill dollar amount (Float)

  Explicit Rules:
  - Program should ask for both bill amount and tip rate
  - Program should calculate the tip
  - Program should output both the tip amount and bill total

  Implicit Rules:
  - Bill total is the sum of original bill + tip amount in dollars
  - To calculate the tip:
    - Convert tip percentage to decimal
    - Multiply bill amount * tip decimal

  Questions:
  

  Mental Model:
  Create a program that asks the user for their bill amount and tip percentage. Calculate the tip amount, then print both the tip amount and total bill including tip.
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++

What is the bill? 200
What is the tip percentage? 15

The tip is $30.0
The total is $230.0


D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Numbers (floats and integers)

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Ask the user for the amount of their bill
    1. Store this amount in variable 'bill'
    2. Convert the bill amount to a Float
  2. Ask the user for their tip percentage
    1. Store this percentage in variable 'tip_percentage'
    2. Convert percentage to a Float
  3. Convert tip percentage to decimal, store in variable 'tip_rate'
    1. Do this by: tip_percentage / 100
  4. Calculate the amount of the tip, store this result in a variable 'tip_amount'.   tip_amount = bill * tip_rate
  5. Print the tip amount
  6. Print the total bill amount (add tip_amount to bill)
