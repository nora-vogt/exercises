Write a method that takes a number as an argument. If the argument is a positive number, return the negative of that number. If the number is 0 or negative, return the original number.

P  (Understand the Problem) +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Inputs:
    - A number
  Outputs: 
    - A number

  Explicit Rules:
    - If argument positive, return negative of that number
    - If argument zero, return zero
    - If argument is negative, return the original number

  Implicit Rules:
    - 

  Questions:
    - Should the method work for integers and floats?

  Mental Model:
 
E (Examples & Test Cases)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  negative(5) == -5
  negative(-3) == -3
  negative(0) == 0      # There's no such thing as -0 in ruby

D (Data Structure)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Integers

A (Algorithm)  +++++++++++++++++++++++
  1. Define a method that takes one argument, a number
  2. Check if the number is positive
    A. If yes, convert the number to a negative and return that number
      1. To convert a number to its negative, multiply it by -1
    B. If number is equal to 0, return 0
    C. If number is already negative, return that number
